						<h3>meow-script</h3>
							<div class ="demo-body">
								<p>meow-script is a very simple script that adds a cat to your terminal! A more detailed explanation is that it served as a way to get my feet wet with making a command line script for linux. This script also served as a way for me to familiarize myself with the <code>getopt</code> BASH command and how it parses arguments provided to it via the command line.</p>
								<p>Through this script I also learned about how to use BASH commands to go through the file structure of a system and locate the directory a script was being called from. Overall a simple project but one that was nonetheless a fun way to start learning more about how to try and practically code with BASH.</p>
								<p>Plus, who wouldn't want to be able to meow on command inside the terminal?</p> 
								<p>If you'd like to check out the project and maybe download it for yourself, you can find the repository on my GitHub by clicking the icon below.</p><br>
