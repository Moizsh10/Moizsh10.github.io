		<h2>About Me</h2>
		
		<p>I am a Mechatronics Engineering graduate with a minor in Embedded Systems Integration from Texas A&M University, class of 2023. Gig 'Em Aggies! At A&M for my Capstone Project, I worked with the local H3 Baseball Training facility to develop an automated Strike-Out detection system utilizing the OpenCV machine vision libraries. This was implemented at the training field to aid training games with quick and accurate callouts.</p>
		
		<p>I've worked in the Oil & Gas and Automation industries, and have hands on, practical experience working with and programming robotic systems as well as installing Machine Vision systems on oil rigs to work in tandem with automated robotic systems</p>
